# Covid-19 Detection from Chest CT Scans

This project implements a deep learning-based classification model to detect **COVID-19** from chest CT scan images. A modified **Inception V3** architecture is used in conjunction with a custom deep neural network (DNN) classifier to achieve efficient and accurate detection.

---

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide an accessible and automated diagnostic tool to assist in the rapid identification of COVID-19 infections from chest imaging. The model distinguishes between:

- COVID-19 positive cases
- Normal (healthy) cases
- Pneumonia (non-COVID) cases

---

## Dataset

We used the publicly available **COVID-19 CT scan dataset** from Kaggle:  
[COVID-19 CT Scans Dataset â€“ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/covid19-ct-scans)

---

## Model Architecture

- Pre-trained **Inception V3** model (modified to suit CT scan input)
- Custom **DNN classifier** on top of extracted features
- Fine-tuned with transfer learning for COVID-19 classification
